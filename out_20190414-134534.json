Operating a vessel in gale\nconditions requires experience and properly equipped vessels. It\nis highly recommended that mariners without the proper experience\nseek safe harbor prior to the onset of gale conditions.\n\nA Dense Fog Advisory means visibilities will frequently be\nreduced to less than one mile. Inexperienced mariners, especially\nthose operating smaller vessels should avoid navigating in these\nconditions.\n\nA Small Craft Advisory means that sustained wind speeds or\nfrequent gusts of 25 to 33 kt and/or seas of 5 ft or higher are\nexpected or occurring, and hazardous to small craft.\nInexperienced mariners, especially those operating smaller\nvessels, should avoid navigating in these conditions.",

Operating a vessel in gale\nconditions requires experience and properly equipped vessels. It\nis highly recommended that mariners without the proper experience\nseek safe harbor prior to the onset of gale conditions.\n\nA Dense Fog Advisory means visibilities will frequently be\nreduced to less than one mile. Inexperienced mariners, especially\nthose operating smaller vessels should avoid navigating in these\nconditions.\n\nA Small Craft Advisory means that sustained wind speeds or\nfrequent gusts of 25 to 33 kt and/or seas of 5 ft or higher are\nexpected or occurring, and hazardous to small craft.\nInexperienced mariners, especially those operating smaller\nvessels, should avoid navigating in these conditions.",

Operating a vessel in gale\nconditions requires experience and properly equipped vessels.

Inexperienced mariners, especially\nthose operating smaller vessels should avoid navigating in these\nconditions.\n\nA Small Craft Advisory means that sustained wind speeds or\nfrequent gusts of 25 to 33 kt and/or seas of 5 ft or higher are\nexpected or occurring, and hazardous to small craft.\nInexperienced mariners, especially those operating smaller\nvessels, should avoid navigating in these conditions.",

Operating a vessel in gale\nconditions requires experience and properly equipped vessels.

Inexperienced mariners, especially\nthose operating smaller vessels should avoid navigating in these\nconditions.\n\nA Small Craft Advisory means that sustained wind speeds or\nfrequent gusts of 25 to 33 kt and/or seas of 5 ft or higher are\nexpected or occurring, and hazardous to small craft.\nInexperienced mariners, especially those operating smaller\nvessels, should avoid navigating in these conditions.",

The Gale\nWatch is no longer in effect.\n\n* WINDS AND SEAS...West to Northwest winds 20 to 30 kt with gusts\nup to 40 kt. Seas 7 to 10 feet.\n\n* VISIBILITY...1 mile or less.",
                "instruction": "A Gale Warning means sustained winds or frequent gusts of 34 to\n47 kt are expected or occurring. Operating a vessel in gale\nconditions requires experience and properly equipped vessels. It\nis highly recommended that mariners without the proper experience\nseek safe harbor prior to the onset of gale conditions.\n\nA Dense Fog Advisory means visibilities will frequently be\nreduced to less than one mile. Inexperienced mariners, especially\nthose operating smaller vessels should avoid navigating in these\nconditions.\n\nA Small Craft Advisory means that sustained wind speeds or\nfrequent gusts of 25 to 33 kt and/or seas of 5 ft or higher are\nexpected or occurring, and hazardous to small craft.\nInexperienced mariners, especially those operating smaller\nvessels, should avoid navigating in these conditions.",

Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and\nsigns.\n\nIf you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain\ncalm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for\nhelp. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to\nshore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to\nswim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.\n\nA High Surf Advisory means that high surf will affect beaches in\nthe advisory area, producing localized beach erosion and\ndangerous swimming conditions.",
