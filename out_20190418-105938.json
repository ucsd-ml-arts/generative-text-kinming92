Strong to\nsevere thunderstorms are expected to develop with this system.\nEfficient rainfall is anticipated to result with rain rates at\ntimes high enough to produce flash flooding. The threat of\nflooding rains will diminish after the passage of a strong cold\nfront later in the day from west to east.\nThe Flash Flood Watch continues for\n\n* portions of southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi,\nincluding the following areas, in southeast Louisiana, East\nBaton Rouge, East Feliciana, Livingston, Northern Tangipahoa,\nPointe Coupee, Southern Tangipahoa, St. Helena, St. Tammany,\nWashington, West Baton Rouge, and West Feliciana. In southern\nMississippi, Amite, Pike, Walthall, and Wilkinson.\n\n* until 10 PM CDT this evening\n\n* Generally 2 to 3 inches of rainfall with locally higher\namounts to 5 inches possible. Rain rates at times may approach\n4 inches per hour for several minutes.\n\n* Impacts include rapid rises on area small streams and creeks.\nRapid ponding of water that may overwhelm local drainage\ncapacities due to excessive rain rates.",
