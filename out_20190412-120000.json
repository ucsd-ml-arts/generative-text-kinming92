In addition, with\nincreasing winds and seas, water levels will become 1 to 2 feet\nabove normal on Saturday. Near times of high tide, minor overwash\nof low lying coastal roads will be a possibility. This includes\nportions of the Bolivar Peninsula, Blue Water Highway and Surfside.\nThe National Weather Service in Houston/Galveston has issued a\nBeach Hazards Statement for a high risk of rip currents, elevated surf\nand above normal water levels. It is in effect through Saturday evening.\n\n* HAZARDS...Strong rip currents, elevated surf, minor coastal flooding.\n\n* TIMING...through Saturday.\n\n* LOCATION...Gulf facing shoreline along the upper Texas coast.\n\n* POTENTIAL IMPACTS...Rip currents can become life threatening to anyone\nentering the surf and can even sweep the strongest swimmer out\nto sea. Minor coastal flooding on Saturday could make travel difficult\nalong low lying coastal roads, particularly between Surfside and the\nBolivar Peninsula.",

Heed the advice of lifeguards...beach patrol...\nflags and signs. Swim near a lifeguard.",

                "description": "A sprawling low pressure system located across the northern Plains\nwill slowly weaken today into tonight as it tracks northeast across\nLake Superior and eventually towards James Bay. Showers and possibly\na few rumbles of thunder will accompany this system this morning as\na cold front sweeps through the region. A tight pressure gradient\nwill continue to lead gusty easterly winds that will gradually veer\nsouth/southeasterly this morning, and then southwest this afternoon.\nGusts across much of the local waters will be as high as 30 knots at\ntimes, with a few sporadic gusts to gales possible over the Lake\nHuron open waters early this morning, and across western Lake Erie\nthis afternoon. The sporadic nature of the gust potential will\npreclude any gale headlines at this time. However, the combination\nof gusty winds and continued elevated wave action will result in\nhazardous conditions for small craft across all of the Lake Huron\nnearshore waters, Saginaw Bay, Lake St. Clair, and western Lake\nErie.\n\nA lingering pressure gradient will result in southwest winds\nremaining gusty into Saturday as high pressure ridges eastward into\nthe central Great Lakes, but with gusts generally limited to around\n20 knots for most of the local waters outside of Saginaw Bay where\ngusts of 25-30 knots will be possible. Nearshore conditions will\nimprove with offshore flow and decreasing waves, with the exception\nbeing Saginaw Bay where hazardous small craft conditions will likely\npersist through much of Saturday. Winds will weaken briefly Saturday\nnight as they veer northwesterly. Another low pressure system will\nthen track northeast towards the region from the lower Mississippi\nValley Sunday, with strengthening and veering northeasterly flow\nleading to another round of potential gales and hazardous conditions\nfor small craft.\n* WIND AND WAVES: During the Small Craft Advisory, expect\nsustained winds up to 20 knots from the south with gusts up\nto 27 knots. The largest expected significant waves will be 7\nfeet with a potential maximum wave height of 10 feet.\n\n* TIMING: The maximum winds are expected around 11 AM EDT Friday\nwith the largest waves expected around 9 AM EDT Friday.\n\nRefer to the latest marine forecasts for greater detail.",
                "instruction": "A Small Craft Advisory means that wind speeds of 21 to 33 knots\nare expected to produce hazardous wave conditions to small craft.\nInexperienced mariners...especially those operating smaller\nvessels should avoid navigating in these conditions.",

                "description": "A sprawling low pressure system located across the northern Plains\nwill slowly weaken today into tonight as it tracks northeast across\nLake Superior and eventually towards James Bay. Showers and possibly\na few rumbles of thunder will accompany this system this morning as\na cold front sweeps through the region. A tight pressure gradient\nwill continue to lead gusty easterly winds that will gradually veer\nsouth/southeasterly this morning, and then southwest this afternoon.\nGusts across much of the local waters will be as high as 30 knots at\ntimes, with a few sporadic gusts to gales possible over the Lake\nHuron open waters early this morning, and across western Lake Erie\nthis afternoon. The sporadic nature of the gust potential will\npreclude any gale headlines at this time. However, the combination\nof gusty winds and continued elevated wave action will result in\nhazardous conditions for small craft across all of the Lake Huron\nnearshore waters, Saginaw Bay, Lake St. Clair, and western Lake\nErie.\n\nA lingering pressure gradient will result in southwest winds\nremaining gusty into Saturday as high pressure ridges eastward into\nthe central Great Lakes, but with gusts generally limited to around\n20 knots for most of the local waters outside of Saginaw Bay where\ngusts of 25-30 knots will be possible. Nearshore conditions will\nimprove with offshore flow and decreasing waves, with the exception\nbeing Saginaw Bay where hazardous small craft conditions will likely\npersist through much of Saturday. Winds will weaken briefly Saturday\nnight as they veer northwesterly. Another low pressure system will\nthen track northeast towards the region from the lower Mississippi\nValley Sunday, with strengthening and veering northeasterly flow\nleading to another round of potential gales and hazardous conditions\nfor small craft.\nThe Small Craft Advisory is now in effect until 4 PM EDT\nSaturday.\n\n* WIND AND WAVES: During the Small Craft Advisory, expect\nsustained winds up to 21 knots from the southwest with gusts\nup to 31 knots. The largest expected significant waves will\nbe 7 feet with a potential maximum wave height of 10 feet.\n\n* TIMING: The maximum winds are expected around 10 AM EDT\nSaturday with the largest waves expected around 9 AM EDT\nFriday.\n\nRefer to the latest marine forecasts for greater detail.",

                "description": "A sprawling low pressure system located across the northern Plains\nwill slowly weaken today into tonight as it tracks northeast across\nLake Superior and eventually towards James Bay. Showers and possibly\na few rumbles of thunder will accompany this system this morning as\na cold front sweeps through the region. A tight pressure gradient\nwill continue to lead gusty easterly winds that will gradually veer\nsouth/southeasterly this morning, and then southwest this afternoon.\nGusts across much of the local waters will be as high as 30 knots at\ntimes, with a few sporadic gusts to gales possible over the Lake\nHuron open waters early this morning, and across western Lake Erie\nthis afternoon. The sporadic nature of the gust potential will\npreclude any gale headlines at this time. However, the combination\nof gusty winds and continued elevated wave action will result in\nhazardous conditions for small craft across all of the Lake Huron\nnearshore waters, Saginaw Bay, Lake St. Clair, and western Lake\nErie.\n\nA lingering pressure gradient will result in southwest winds\nremaining gusty into Saturday as high pressure ridges eastward into\nthe central Great Lakes, but with gusts generally limited to around\n20 knots for most of the local waters outside of Saginaw Bay where\ngusts of 25-30 knots will be possible. Nearshore conditions will\nimprove with offshore flow and decreasing waves, with the exception\nbeing Saginaw Bay where hazardous small craft conditions will likely\npersist through much of Saturday. Winds will weaken briefly Saturday\nnight as they veer northwesterly. Another low pressure system will\nthen track northeast towards the region from the lower Mississippi\nValley Sunday, with strengthening and veering northeasterly flow\nleading to another round of potential gales and hazardous conditions\nfor small craft.\n* WIND AND WAVES: During the Small Craft Advisory, expect\nsustained winds up to 20 knots from the southwest with gusts\nup to 30 knots. The largest expected significant waves will\nbe 3 feet with a potential maximum wave height of 4 feet.\n\n* TIMING: The maximum winds are expected around 5 PM EDT Friday\nwith the largest waves expected around 6 PM EDT Friday.\n\nRefer to the latest marine forecasts for greater detail.",
                "instruction": "A Small Craft Advisory means that wind speeds of 21 to 33 knots\nare expected to produce hazardous wave conditions to small craft.\nInexperienced mariners...especially those operating smaller\nvessels should avoid navigating in these conditions.",
