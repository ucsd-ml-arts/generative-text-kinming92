Note:
- There are some interesting points in this generated text
- This two alert combine many different places into one messages with the theme of thunderstorm and flood warning
- Somehow the model generates non existing places like "Northwestern Connecticutal County in central North Carolina...", "Dougher water,Shelbina, Rouge County" in Missouri, "The West Fork Des Moines River Near Windicated"
- But they all fit in the right places of the text
- The timeline matches as it starts from 315pm , then 505pm based on the first alert.
