High pressure will be short lived as the\nnext strong low lifts northeast out of the lower Mississippi\nValley reaching Lake Erie Sunday evening. Increased easterly\ngradient on the north side of the low will result in gusts to near\ngales Sunday evening and overnight. Small craft advisories may be\nneeded at a minimum for increased wave heights building along the\nshoreline with winds around 25 knots.\n* WIND AND WAVES: During the Small Craft Advisory, expect\nsustained winds up to 21 knots from the southwest with gusts\nup to 28 knots.

Movement was northeast at 25 mph.\nPeriods of weak rotation have been witnessed in a few of these\nstorms.\n\nNickel size hail, heavy rain, and wind gusts of 50 to 55 mph will be\npossible with these storms.\n\nLocations impacted include...\nFayetteville, Raeford, Lillington, Fort Bragg, Dunn, Angier, Benson,\nGodwin, Pope AFB and Antioch.",
                "instruction": "Seek shelter in a nearby building or vehicle. Wind gusts as high as\n50 mph are capable of knocking down small or weakened trees and\nblowing around trash cans, potted plants, lawn furniture and other\nlight outdoor objects.\n\nLocally heavy rain will quickly reduce visibility and result in\nponding of water on roadways, standing water in low lying areas, and\nminor flooding of creeks, streams, and areas of poor drainage.\nDrivers are urged to slow down and use extra caution to avoid\nhydroplaning, especially in urban areas where prolonged heavy rain\ncan quickly lead to flooding.",
