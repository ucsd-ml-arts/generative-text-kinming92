                "description": "At 339 AM EDT, the river gauge at Washburn indicated a water level\nof 17.13 feet, which is moderate flood stage.  Ice jams still locked\nin place near Washburn and Crouseville along with continued river\nrises will cause low land flooding in the warned area. Low lying\nstructures on Gardner Creek Road may begin to flood today.\n\nThe combination of pre-existing ice jams and continued snowmelt will\nresult in a continued slow rise of river levels through this\nafternoon or until the ice jam releases.  In addition, brief rapid\nrises are possible once the ice locked in place begins to break up\nand move. Those residents who are impacted by flooding in Washburn,\nWade and Crouseville along the Aroostook River should closely watch\nthe river levels over the coming days due to the increased flood\nthreat.\n\nSome locations that will experience flooding include...\nCrouseville, Washburn and Wade.",
                "instruction": "Turn around, don't drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood\ndeaths occur in vehicles.\n\nTo report flooding, contact the National Weather Service in Caribou\nat 1-800-909-5970 or visit https://inws.ncep.noaa.gov/report. You\nmay also contact local law enforcement.",

The highest threat areas\nfor flooding will be in regions that have pre-existing ice jams\nfrom this past winter.\n\n* A second flood threat will be small stream flooding with many\nsmall streams already at or near bankfull. This could lead to\nflooding in lowland areas bordering the streams. Low lying roads\nand small stream crossings could become impassable due to\nflooding.
