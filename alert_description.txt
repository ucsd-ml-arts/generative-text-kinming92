Alert:
The risk of strong rip currents will persist through Saturday.
Swim near a lifeguard and stay away from rocks, piers and
jetties where they are particularly strong. In addition, with
increasing winds and seas, water levels will become 1 to 2 feet
above normal on Saturday. Near times of high tide, minor overwash
of low lying coastal roads will be a possibility. This includes
portions of the Bolivar Peninsula, Blue Water Highway and Surfside.
The National Weather Service in Houston/Galveston has issued a

and above normal water levels. It is in effect through Saturday evening.

* HAZARDS...Strong rip currents, elevated surf, minor coastal flooding.

* TIMING...through Saturday.

* LOCATION...Gulf facing shoreline along the upper Texas coast.

* POTENTIAL IMPACTS...Rip currents can become life threatening to anyone
entering the surf and can even sweep the strongest swimmer out
to sea. Minor coastal flooding on Saturday could make travel difficult
along low lying coastal roads, particularly between Surfside and the
Bolivar Peninsula.
Instruction:
A Beach Hazards Statement is issued when threats such as rip
currents...longshore currents...sneaker waves and other hazards
create life-threatening conditions in the surf zone. Caution
should be used when in or near the water.

Instruction:

Alert:
A sprawling low pressure system located across the northern Plains
will slowly weaken today into tonight as it tracks northeast across
Lake Superior and eventually towards James Bay. Showers and possibly
a few rumbles of thunder will accompany this system this morning as
a cold front sweeps through the region. A tight pressure gradient
will continue to lead gusty easterly winds that will gradually veer
south/southeasterly this morning, and then southwest this afternoon.
Gusts across much of the local waters will be as high as 30 knots at
times, with a few sporadic gusts to gales possible over the Lake
Huron open waters early this morning, and across western Lake Erie
this afternoon. The sporadic nature of the gust potential will
preclude any gale headlines at this time. However, the combination
of gusty winds and continued elevated wave action will result in
hazardous conditions for small craft across all of the Lake Huron
nearshore waters, Saginaw Bay, Lake St. Clair, and western Lake
Erie.

A lingering pressure gradient will result in southwest winds
remaining gusty into Saturday as high pressure ridges eastward into
the central Great Lakes, but with gusts generally limited to around
20 knots for most of the local waters outside of Saginaw Bay where
gusts of 25-30 knots will be possible. Nearshore conditions will
improve with offshore flow and decreasing waves, with the exception
being Saginaw Bay where hazardous small craft conditions will likely
persist through much of Saturday. Winds will weaken briefly Saturday
night as they veer northwesterly. Another low pressure system will
then track northeast towards the region from the lower Mississippi
Valley Sunday, with strengthening and veering northeasterly flow
leading to another round of potential gales and hazardous conditions
for small craft.
* WIND AND WAVES: During the Small Craft Advisory, expect
sustained winds up to 20 knots from the south with gusts up
to 27 knots. The largest expected significant waves will be 7
feet with a potential maximum wave height of 10 feet.

* TIMING: The maximum winds are expected around 11 AM EDT Friday
with the largest waves expected around 9 AM EDT Friday.

continues and streams continue to rise.  It will take some
time for all response to the earlier heavy rainfall to
subside so the Flash Flood Warning will continue.  Drivers
and residents are urged to heed all barricades and seek
higher ground well away from all streams until the threat
has subsided and barricades have been removed.

Alert:
A strong spring storm system will likely bring an accumulation of
very wet and slushy snow to portions of northern Illinois and
extreme northwest Indiana on Sunday. The heaviest snowfall rates
are expected to occur from a bit prior to sunrise through mid day
or the early afternoon, with lower intensities during the
afternoon. The snow will end by early evening. There will likely
be a fairly narrow band where these heavy snowfall rates of up to
one inch per hour are most persistent. Exactly where this sets
up, two to four inches of accumulation are likely on colder or
elevated surfaces, with locally higher amounts possible.


With warm road temperatures and the strong April sun, roads will
likely be mainly wet most of the time. However, it's possible that
some slush may cover bridges or overpasses and less traveled
roadways during the heaviest snowfall. While overall lack of
accumulation on roads may limit the magnitude of travel impacts,
visibility will likely be sharply reduced at times. In addition,
northerly winds gusting up to 25 to 35 mph could plaster the very
wet and heavy snow onto elevated surfaces, including tree
branches, so minor tree damage is possible. Motorists are advised
to prepare for potentially adverse travel conditions on Sunday.
Continue to stay tuned for the latest forecast updates.

The National Weather Service in Detroit/Pontiac has issued a
Lakeshore Flood Warning, which is in effect until 8 PM EDT
Monday. The Lakeshore Flood Advisory is no longer in effect.

* Lakeshore Flooding...Sustained east northeast wind near 30 mph
with higher gusts will continue through mid afternoon along the
western shoreline of Lake Erie. Although wind speed will begin
to diminish by 4 PM, continued onshore flow from the northeast
will support an ongoing flooding threat, especially from Luna
Pier to Maumee Bay.

* Impacts...At 130 PM water levels at Toledo, Fermi, and Gibraltar
were 82, 72, and 68 inches above chart datum respectively.
Additional rises will be possible through 4 PM before wind
begins to turn northerly and weaken. The greatest flooding
potential will be between Luna Pier and the Ohio border.
Instruction:
To learn more about dangerous waves and currents please visit

A Lakeshore Flood Warning means that flooding is occurring or
imminent along the lake. Residents on or near the shore in the
warned area should be alert for rising water...and take
appropriate action to protect life and property.

* Prepare, plan and stay informed. Visit www.weather.gov/safety
Alert:
* Lakeshore Flooding...Northeast wind will continue to
strengthen today, peaking near 30 mph with gusts up to 40 mph
this evening. Wind will then switch gradually to the north
overnight and remain strong into Monday morning. These winds
will lead to very high waves as well as a general increase in
the lake water level.

* Impacts...The high waves and rising water level will lead to
significant beach erosion in some areas and localized
lakeshore flooding from this afternoon into tonight before
gradually improving on Monday morning.
Instruction:
A Lakeshore Flood Advisory indicates that onshore winds will
generate flooding of low areas along the lakeshore.

plateaued in the short term, northeast winds up to 35 mph with
higher gusts are still forecast to develop and persist from 4 PM
through midnight. The persistent onshore flow and elevated
waves will result in flooding along the immediate lakeshore.


* Impacts...The water level at Essexville was 52 inches above
chart datum at 130 PM and is expected to begin steadily
increasing no later than 5 PM. The water level is then forecast
to exceed 60 inches during the evening with a low potential to
reach 70 inches before wind begins to weaken and turn northerly
after midnight. The increased water level, along with high wave
action, will result in flooding of the lakeshore and may damage
suceptible structures along the shoreline.

Alert:
In the wake of yesterday's storm system, much colder air filtered
into the region today on the heels of gusty northwest winds.
Overnight and early Tuesday, Canadian high pressure will settle
over the region allowing winds to diminish. Dewpoints are dropping
into the 30s and will continue to fall overnight. This will allow
temperatures to fall into the lower to mid 30s in many locations
by late tonight.

With clearing skies, diminishing winds, moist ground from recent
rainfall, and the cold air mass, areas of frost are likely to
develop late tonight and early Tuesday morning across many parts
of the Virginia and North Carolina Piedmont. The most likely
locations for frost formation will be in valleys or low- lying
areas and rural sheltered locations. The frost could be sufficient
enough to kill sensitive vegetation and young crops that have
recently sprouted as well as budding and blooming plant, trees,
and flowers from the recent warm temperatures.

Precautions should be taken now to protect sensitive vegetation,
plants, and trees if at all possible. Potted house plants should
be brought indoors overnight to prevent them from being damaged or
killed.
The National Weather Service in Blacksburg has issued a Frost
Advisory, which is in effect from 2 AM to 9 AM EDT Tuesday.

plants and trees could be damaged or killed from frost and/or a
light freeze.

flooding for a few hours before and after high tide could make travel
difficult along low lying coastal roads, particularly between Surfside
and the Bolivar Peninsula.
Instruction:
There is a high risk of rip currents. Life threatening rip
currents are likely in the surf zone.

Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore...which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins...
jetties and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards...beach patrol...
flags and signs. Swim near a lifeguard.

If you become caught in a rip current...yell for help. Remain
calm...do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current...swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.

Alert:
Recent warm temperatures have caused increased snowmelt and
weakened the remaining river ice across northern Maine. Rivers
will continue to rise over the next 12 to 24 hours due to the
recent snowmelt and rain in the Flood Watch area. Small river
flooding is expected to bring localized impacts to the region
today. Smaller rivers will crest this morning and begin to trend
down tonight into Wednesday. River ice will continue to move on
the Aroostook and Saint John River systems over the next 24 hours.
Ice jam flooding could be possible, especially in areas that had
pre-existing ice jams from this past winter.
The Flood Watch continues for

* A portion of Far Northern Maine, including the following
areas, Northeast Aroostook and Northwest Aroostook.

* Through late tonight.

* Snowmelt may lead to ice jam flooding along the Saint John and
Aroostook Rivers. The highest threat areas for flooding will be
in regions that have pre-existing ice jams from this past
winter.

* A second flood threat will be small stream flooding with many
small streams already at or near bankfull. This could lead to
flooding in lowland areas bordering the streams. Low lying
roads and small stream crossings could become impassable due
to flooding. Never drive into a flooded road, turn around
don't drown. Small streams and rivers will crest this morning
and begin to trend down over the next day.
