Small river\nflooding is expected to bring localized impacts to the region.\nSmaller rivers should crest this evening then begin to trend down\novernight into Wednesday. River ice will continue to move on the\nAroostook and Saint John River systems over the next 24 hours. Ice\njam flooding could be possible, especially in areas that had\npre-existing ice jams from this past winter.\nThe Flood Watch continues for\n\n* A portion of Far Northern Maine, including the following\nareas, Northeast Aroostook and Northwest Aroostook.\n\n* Until 2 AM EDT Wednesday.\n\n* Snowmelt may lead to ice jam flooding along the Saint John and\nAroostook Rivers. The highest threat areas for flooding will\nbe in regions that have pre-existing ice jams from this past\nwinter.\n\n* A second flood threat will be small stream flooding with many\nsmall streams already at or near bankfull. This could lead to\nflooding in lowland areas bordering the streams. Low lying roads\nand small stream crossings could become impassable due to\nflooding. Never drive into a flooded road, turn around don't\ndrown. Small streams and rivers will crest this evening then\nbegin to trend down overnight into Wednesday.",
                "instruction": "A Flood Watch means there is a potential for flooding based on\ncurrent forecasts.\n\nYou should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible\nFlood Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be\nprepared to take action should flooding develop.",

Near times of high tide, minor\noverwash of low lying coastal roads may occur. This includes\nportions of the Bolivar Peninsula, Blue Water Highway and\nSurfside.\nThe National Weather Service in Houston/Galveston has issued a\nHigh Rip Current Risk, which is in effect through Thursday\nafternoon.\n\n* HAZARDS...Strong rip currents, elevated surf and minor coastal flooding\non Gulf facing shores.\n\n* TIMING...Through Thursday afternoon.\n\n* IMPACTS...Rip currents can become life threatening to anyone entering the\nsurf and can even sweep the strongest swimmer out to sea. Minor coastal\nflooding for a few hours before and after high tide could make travel\ndifficult along low lying coastal roads, particularly between Surfside\nand the Bolivar Peninsula.",
                "instruction": "There is a high risk of rip currents. Life threatening rip\ncurrents are likely in the surf zone.\n\nRip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away\nfrom shore...which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the\nsandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins...\njetties and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards...beach patrol...\nflags and signs. Swim near a lifeguard.\n\nIf you become caught in a rip current...yell for help. Remain\ncalm...do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for\nhelp. If you have to swim out of a rip current...swim parallel to\nshore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to\nswim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.",

Ice jams still\nlocked in place near Washburn and Crouseville along with continued\nriver rises will cause low land flooding in the warned area.\n\n* The combination of pre-existing ice jams and continued snowmelt\nwill result in a continued slow rise of river levels through\nWednesday or until the ice jam releases.  In addition, brief rapid\nrises are possible once the ice locked in place begins to break up\nand move. Those residents who are impacted by flooding in\nWashburn, Wade and Crouseville along the Aroostook River should\nclosely watch the river levels over the coming days due to the\nincreased flood threat.\n\n* Some locations that will experience flooding include...\nCrouseville, Washburn and Wade.",
                "instruction": "Turn around, don't drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood\ndeaths occur in vehicles.\n\nTo report flooding, contact the National Weather Service in Caribou\nat 1-800-909-\n5970 or visit https://inws.ncep.noaa.gov/report. You may also contact\nlocal law enforcement.\n\nA Flood Warning means that flooding is imminent or occurring. All\ninterested parties should take necessary precautions immediately.",

River ice will continue to move on\nthe Aroostook and Saint John River systems over the next 24 hours.\nIce jam flooding could be possible, especially in areas that had\npre-existing ice jams from this past winter.\nThe Flood Watch continues for\n\n* A portion of Far Northern Maine, including the following\nareas, Northeast Aroostook and Northwest Aroostook.\n\n* Through late tonight.\n\n* Snowmelt may lead to ice jam flooding along the Saint John and\nAroostook Rivers. The highest threat areas for flooding will be\nin regions that have pre-existing ice jams from this past\nwinter.\n\n* A second flood threat will be small stream flooding with many\nsmall streams already at or near bankfull. This could lead to\nflooding in lowland areas bordering the streams. Low lying\nroads and small stream crossings could become impassable due\nto flooding. Never drive into a flooded road, turn around\ndon't drown. Small streams and rivers will crest this morning\nand begin to trend down over the next day.",
