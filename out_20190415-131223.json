Ice jams in place\nnear Washburn and Crouseville and continued river rises will cause\nlow land flooding in the warned area.\n\nThe combination of pre-existing ice jams and continued snowmelt will\nresult in a slow rise of river levels through at least Wednesday or\nuntil the ice jam releases.  Those residents who are impacted by\nflooding in Washburn, Wade and Crouseville along the Aroostook River\nshould closely watch the river levels over the coming days due to\nthe increased flood threat.\n\n* Some locations that will experience flooding include...\nCrouseville, Washburn and Wade.",

Rainfall will continue through the day with an\nadditional half inch of rain expected by this evening. The rain\nand snowmelt will continue to elevate small streams and creeks\nacross the Flood Watch area. Small river flooding is expected to\nbring localized impacts to the region. River ice will continue to\nmove on the Aroostook and Saint John River systems over the next\n36 hours. Ice jam flooding could be possible, especially in areas\nthat had pre-existing ice jams from this past winter.\nThe Flood Watch continues for\n\n* Portions of Central Highlands Maine, Far Northern Maine, and\nNorth Woods Maine, including the following areas, in Central\nHighlands Maine, Northern Penobscot. In Far Northern Maine,\nNortheast Aroostook and Northwest Aroostook. In North Woods\nMaine, Northern Piscataquis and Northern Somerset.\n\n* Through Tuesday morning.\n\n* Rainfall and snowmelt may lead to ice jam flooding along the\nSaint John and Aroostook Rivers. The highest threat areas for\nflooding will be in regions that have pre-existing ice jams\nfrom this past winter.\n\n* A second flood threat will be localized small stream flooding\nas excessive snowmelt and rainfall could cause low lying land\nflooding. Low lying roads and small stream crossings could\nbecome impassable due to flooding. Never drive into a flooded\nroad, turn around don't drown.",
                "instruction": "A Flood Watch means there is a potential for flooding based on\ncurrent forecasts.\n\nYou should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible\nFlood Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be\nprepared to take action should flooding develop.",

There is potential\nof minor low land flooding in the vicinity of the ice jam on the\nAroostook River.\n\nAdditional rainfall of one half of an inch is expected over the\narea.
