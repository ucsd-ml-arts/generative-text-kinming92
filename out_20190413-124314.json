                "description": "A low pressure system remains on track to travel across the Ohio\nValley northeast into New England Sunday into early Monday, which\nwill bring unsettled weather and lake conditions to start off the\nweek. As the low pressure system nears the Ohio Valley, the pressure\ngradient will strengthen across the open waters and will aid in\nquickly ramping up winds speeds and gusts through Sunday morning.\nGusts will peak in excess of 22 knots by late Sunday morning which\nwill result in the initial issuance of small craft advisories across\nLake Erie, St. Clair, and far southern Lake Huron. Gale warnings to\nthen go in effect for nearly all of southern and central Lake Huron\nand Saginaw Bay by Sunday afternoon as northeasterly gusts continue\nto climb to 35 - 40 knots. Long fetch across Lake Huron will also\nresult in waves to or in excess of 9-10 ft across Lake Huron into\nthe outer Saginaw Bay. Strong gusts to continue through early Monday\nmorning before a ridge of high pressure acts to relax the pressure\ngradient.\nThe National Weather Service in Detroit/Pontiac has cancelled the\nSmall Craft Advisory.\n\n* WIND AND WAVES: During the Gale Warning, expect sustained\nwinds up to 35 knots from the northeast with gusts up to 43\nknots. The largest expected significant waves will be 13 feet\nwith a potential maximum wave height of 19 feet.\n\n* TIMING: The maximum winds are expected around 7 PM EDT Sunday\nwith the largest waves expected around 10 PM EDT Sunday.\n\nRefer to the latest marine forecasts for greater detail.",
                "instruction": "A Gale Warning means winds of 34 to 47 knots are imminent or\noccuring. Operating a vessel in gale conditions requires\nexperience and properly equipped vessels. It is highly\nrecommended that mariners without the proper experience seek safe\nharbor prior to the onset of gale conditions.",

                "description": "* At 130 PM EDT, emergency management reported a few roadway\nflooding issues within the warned area with streams still\nrising rapidly.  While heavy rainfall has ended across the\nRock Hill, Fort Mill, and Tega Cay urban areas, additional\nflooding issues may occur shortly as significant runoff\ncontinues and streams continue to rise.  It will take some\ntime for all response to the earlier heavy rainfall to\nsubside so the Flash Flood Warning will continue.  Drivers\nand residents are urged to heed all barricades and seek\nhigher ground well away from all streams until the threat\nhas subsided and barricades have been removed.\n\n* The following streamgauge has exceeded Minor Flood Stage:\nBig Dutchman Creek 5 NNE Rock Hill.\n\nCurrent Stage: 12.57 feet and rising rapidly.\nForecast: Big Dutchman Creek will continue to rise past the\nModerate Flood Stage of 13 feet and may reach 14 feet in the\nnext 60-90 minutes before cresting and beginning to recede.\nAction Stage: 8.0 feet.\nMinor Flood Stage: 9.0 feet.\nModerate Flood Stage: 13.0 feet.\nImpacts: West Oak Dr. and Mt. Gallant Rd. are likely flooded\nwith significant flooding of adjacent low-lying areas\nincluding the backyards of homes in adjacent subdivisions.\nMore significant inundation is possible if the stream exceeds\nModerate Flood Stage and some structures may be threatened.\nResidents near Big Dutchman Creek must pay close attention\nand be prepared to seek higher ground immediately.\n\n* Some locations that may continue to experience flooding\ninclude...Rock Hill, Fort Mill, Tega Cay, Lesslie, Carowinds\nand Newport.\n\n* Streams in the warned area are experiencing rapid rises and\nflooding of adjacent areas will continue.  Some streams and\nassociated tributaries include: Manchester Creek, Big Dutchman\nCreek, and Wildcat Creek.",
                "instruction": "Excessive runoff from heavy rainfall is causing flooding in urban\nareas. Storm drains, streams and other drainages will become\noverwhelmed by excessive rainfall, flooding low-lying roads,\nintersections, and parking lots. Underpasses are especially dangerous\nbecause sudden flood waters can quickly surround and submerge your\nvehicle. Stay alert and avoid flood-prone areas.\n\nWhen it is safe to do so, please report flood waters or landslides\nflowing over roads or threatening property to the National Weather\nService by calling toll free, 1, 800, 2 6 7, 8 1 0 1, by posting on\nour Facebook page, or via Twitter using hashtag NWSGSP. Your message\nshould describe the event and the specific location where it\noccurred, including roadways, nearby cross streets, stream names and\nother landmarks.",

This runoff is still causing significant\nstream response and streamgauges across the area suggest bankfull\nconditions are occurring.\n\n* Minor flooding of adjacent low-lying areas next to streams\nincluding parks, greenways, farmland, and common-access areas\nis likely over the next several hours.  A few roadways may be\nimpacted as well, prompting some road closures. Drivers are urged\nto avoid flooded roadways and obey all barricades, even if water\nis not currently over the road. People near streams are urged to\nseek higher ground and avoid adjacent areas until the high flows\nhave subsided.\n\n* The following gauged streams are reaching or exceeding bankfull\nstages: Long Creek, McDowell Creek, Torrence Creek, and West\nBranch of the Rocky River.\n\n* Some locations that may continue to experience flooding include...\nUptown Charlotte, Huntersville, Central Charlotte, Northeast\nCharlotte, Northwest Charlotte, Cornelius, Mt Holly, Davidson,\nBelmont and Cramerton.",
                "instruction": "Heavy rainfall will cause ponding of water in urban areas, streets\nand underpasses, as well as other poor drainage areas and low lying\nspots. Rapid rises on small creeks and streams will also occur,\npossibly flooding low water crossings and farmland. Do not attempt to\ntravel across flooded roads. Turn around, dont drown.\n\nOnly when it is safe to do so, please report floodwaters or\nlandslides flowing over roads or threatening property to the National\nWeather Service by calling toll-free, 1, 800, 2 6 7, 8 1 0 1, by\nposting on our Facebook page, or via Twitter using hashtag NWSGSP.\nYour message should describe the event and the specific location\nwhere it occurred, including roadways, nearby cross streets, stream\nnames, and other landmarks.",

Areas that are low lying or usually experience poor\ndrainage are most likely to experience flooding. This means some\nlow water crossings in the region may become impassable. Up to one\ninch of rain has already fallen and another 1 to 2 inches is\npossible through 200 pm.\n\n* Some locations that will experience flooding include...\nDallas, Garland, Irving, Grand Prairie, Mesquite, Carrollton,\nRichardson, Mansfield, Rowlett, Desoto, Grapevine, Cedar Hill,\nWylie, Coppell, Duncanville, Lancaster, Waxahachie, Farmers Branch,\nBalch Springs and University Park.",
