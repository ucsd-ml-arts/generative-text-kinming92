Several roads remain closed, and\nmultiple creeks, streams, and rivers remain out of their banks.\nThis includes the Eno River at Huckelberry Springs and Hillsboro\nalong with portions of the Little River.

                "description": "A strong spring storm system will likely bring an accumulation of\nvery wet and slushy snow to portions of northern Illinois and\nextreme northwest Indiana on Sunday. The heaviest snowfall rates\nare expected to occur from a bit prior to sunrise through mid day\nor the early afternoon, with lower intensities during the\nafternoon. The snow will end by early evening. There will likely\nbe a fairly narrow band where these heavy snowfall rates of up to\none inch per hour are most persistent. Exactly where this sets\nup, two to four inches of accumulation are likely on colder or\nelevated surfaces, with locally higher amounts possible.\n\n\nWith warm road temperatures and the strong April sun, roads will\nlikely be mainly wet most of the time. However, it's possible that\nsome slush may cover bridges or overpasses and less traveled\nroadways during the heaviest snowfall. While overall lack of\naccumulation on roads may limit the magnitude of travel impacts,\nvisibility will likely be sharply reduced at times. In addition,\nnortherly winds gusting up to 25 to 35 mph could plaster the very\nwet and heavy snow onto elevated surfaces, including tree\nbranches, so minor tree damage is possible. Motorists are advised\nto prepare for potentially adverse travel conditions on Sunday.\nContinue to stay tuned for the latest forecast updates.",

Additionally,\nseveral roads were impacted and barricades are still in place\nto ensure floodwaters fully recede and to give road crews\ntime to assess road stability.  Therefore, the Flash Flood\nWarning has been cancelled and a Areal Flood Warning has been\nissued in its place.\n\n* The following streamgauge has exceeded Minor Flood Stage:\nWildcat Creek at Robertson Rd. 3 SW Rock Hill.\n\nCurrent Stage: 14.07 feet and rising rapidly.\nForecast: Wildcat Creek will continue to rise to between 14.5\nfeet and 15.0 feet over the next 60 minutes before cresting\nbelow 15.0 feet and beginning to recede early this evening.\nAction Stage: 9.0 feet.\nMinor Flood Stage: 11.0 feet.\nImpacts:  Minor flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to\nWildcat Creek from McConnells Hwy south to Ogden Rd,\nRambo Rd, and Auten Rd is likely. These roadways may be\nimpacted at these levels and some backyard home flooding\nis possible.\n\n* The following streamgauge has exceeded Minor Flood Stage:\nBig Dutchman Creek 5 NNE Rock Hill.\n\nCurrent Stage: 11.58 feet and falling rapidly.\nForecast: Big Dutchman Creek will continue to recede rapidly\nover the next several hours and fall below Minor Flood\nStage within the next 2-4 hours.\nAction Stage: 8.0 feet.\nMinor Flood Stage: 9.0 feet.\nModerate Flood Stage: 13.0 feet.\nImpacts:  Minor flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to\nBig Dutchman Creek near West Oak Rd. and Mt. Gallant Rd.\nwill continue through early evening.  Adjacent roadways\nshould no longer be impacted.\n\n* Some locations that may continue to experience flooding\ninclude...Rock Hill, Fort Mill, Tega Cay, Newport, Lesslie,\nMcconnells and Carowinds.",
                "instruction": "Excessive runoff from heavy rainfall will cause flooding of small\ncreeks and streams, highways, and underpasses. Additionally, country\nroads and farmlands along the banks of creeks, streams, and other\nlow-lying areas are subject to flooding.\n\nNumerous roads, parking lots and bridges will be threatened by heavy\nrapidly rising streams and creeks. Please pay close\nattention to road signs indicating a flood-prone area. Obey all\nbarricades, even if water is not currently over the road. Barricades\nare in place for your protection and indicate areas where flooding\ncan occur rapidly and without warning.\n\nOnly when it is safe to do so, please report floodwaters or\nlandslides flowing over roads or threatening property to the National\nWeather Service by calling toll-free, 1, 800, 2 6 7, 8 1 0 1, by\nposting on our Facebook page, or via Twitter using hashtag NWSGSP.\nYour message should describe the event and the specific location\nwhere it occurred, including roadways, nearby cross streets, stream\nnames and other landmarks.",

This will cause nuisance flooding of low-lying\nareas adjacent to these streams and associated tributaries.\nPeople are encouraged to avoid greenways, parks, and adjacent\nareas until stream levels recede.\n\n* The following streamgauge has exceeded Action Stage:\nRocky River above Irish Buffalo Creek Confluence, 5 W Georgeville\n\nCurrent Stage: 13.49 feet and rising steadily.\nForecast: The Rocky River will continue to rise to 14-14.5 feet\nover the next 60-90 minutes before cresting and beginning to\nrecede.\nAction Stage: 12.0 feet.\nMinor Flood Stage: 16.5 feet.\nImpacts: Flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to the river is\nlikely with backwater effects causing rises along Back Creek\nand Reedy Creek.\n\n* Some locations that may continue to experience flooding\ninclude...West Concord, Harrisburg, Charlotte Motor Speedway,\nMidland, Downtown Concord, and Mt Pleasant.",
                "instruction": "Heavy rainfall is causing ponding of water in urban areas, streets\nand underpasses, as well as other poor drainage areas and low lying\nspots. Rapid rises on small creeks and streams will also occur,\npossibly flooding low water crossings and farmland. Do not attempt to\ntravel across flooded roads. Turn around, dont drown.",

This will combine with\nincreasing snow melt due to warm temperatures through Sunday\nmorning to produce significant runoff into area rivers and\nstreams. Main stem rivers most at risk for minor category\nflooding include the Ausable, Missisquoi, Passumpsic, Otter\nCreek, Winooski, Lamoille, and possibly the Mad river. Sharp\nriver rises are likely beginning Sunday night. Most main stem\nrivers are expected to crest during the day Monday based on\ncurrent indications.\n\n* Those with interests in low-lying or flood prone areas should\ncontinue to monitor the latest forecasts over the weekend and\ninto Monday.",
