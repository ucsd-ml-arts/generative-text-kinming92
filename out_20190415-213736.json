                "description": "In the wake of yesterday's storm system, much colder air filtered\ninto the region today on the heels of gusty northwest winds.\nOvernight and early Tuesday, Canadian high pressure will settle\nover the region allowing winds to diminish. Dewpoints are dropping\ninto the 30s and will continue to fall overnight. This will allow\ntemperatures to fall into the lower to mid 30s in many locations\nby late tonight.\n\nWith clearing skies, diminishing winds, moist ground from recent\nrainfall, and the cold air mass, areas of frost are likely to\ndevelop late tonight and early Tuesday morning across many parts\nof the Virginia and North Carolina Piedmont. The most likely\nlocations for frost formation will be in valleys or low- lying\nareas and rural sheltered locations. The frost could be sufficient\nenough to kill sensitive vegetation and young crops that have\nrecently sprouted as well as budding and blooming plant, trees,\nand flowers from the recent warm temperatures.\n\nPrecautions should be taken now to protect sensitive vegetation,\nplants, and trees if at all possible. Potted house plants should\nbe brought indoors overnight to prevent them from being damaged or\nkilled.\nThe National Weather Service in Blacksburg has issued a Frost\nAdvisory, which is in effect from 2 AM to 9 AM EDT Tuesday.\n\n* Temperatures...dropping into the lower to mid 30s...32 to 37 by\nearly Tuesday morning.\n\n* Timing...coldest temperatures in the 4 AM to 8 AM time frame.\n\n* Impacts...sensitive vegetation, plants, and budding or blooming\nplants and trees could be damaged or killed from frost and/or a\nlight freeze.\n\n* Locations...Virginia and North Carolina Piedmont and Foothills.",
                "instruction": "A Frost Advisory means that widespread frost is expected.\nSensitive outdoor plants may be killed if left uncovered.",

Those headwaters and\ntributaries have crested and stream levels are quickly returning to\nnormal levels. The resultant floodwave has peaked along the middle\nFrench Broad River from Horse Shoe to Fletcher to Bent Creek and\nis now beginning to recede.  However, the French Broad River will\nremain above Action/Advisory Stage through Tuesday morning,\nresulting in nuisance inundation of adjacent low-lying areas\nincluding farmland and boat access ramps. Therefore, the Flood\nAdvisory will continue through Tuesday morning.\nThe Flood Advisory continues for\nthe French Broad River Near Fletcher\n* until Tuesday morning.\n* The French Broad River near Fletcher crested at 10.22 feet\nat 245 AM on April 15, 2019.\n* At 07 PM Monday the stage was 10.1 feet and falling slowly.\n* Action/Advisory Stage is 10.0 feet.\n* Minor Flood Stage is 13.0 feet.\n* FORECAST: The river will continue to fall slowly below Action/\nAdvisory Stage by Tuesday morning.\n* IMPACTS: At 10.0 feet: Action/Advisory Stage. The French Broad\nRiver has exceeded bankfull at the gauge site. Isolated farmland\nflooding is beginning across the French Broad River Valley from\nEtowah downstream to Avery Creek upstream of the gauge site.",
                "instruction": "PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...\n\nA Flood Advisory for a river forecast point means that nuisance\nflooding is expected to occur along the river when the river level is\nforecast to be just below or at the official Minor Flood Stage.\n\nCaution is urged when walking near river banks...keep children away\nfrom drainage areas and culverts.",

                "description": "..at Blantyre affecting Henderson and Transylvania Counties\n\nHeavy rainfall of 2-5 inches across Transylvania County during the\n24-hour period ending the evening of April 14, 2019 caused\nexcessive runoff and resulted in significant rises in the\nheadwaters of the French Broad River and associated tributaries\nincluding the Davidson and Little Rivers.  Those headwaters and\ntributaries have crested and stream levels are quickly returning to\nnormal levels. The resultant floodwave has peaked along the Upper\nFrench Broad River from Brevard to Etowah and Horse Shoe and is now\nbeginning to recede. Minor Flood Stage was not reached during this\nflood event; therefore, more significant inundation of low-lying\nareas adjacent to the river will not occur and the Flood Warning\nhas been cancelled.  However, the French Broad River will remain\nabove Action/Advisory Stage through Tuesday morning, resulting in\nnusiance inundation of adjacent low-lying areas including\nfarmland and boat access ramps. Therefore, the Flood Warning has\nbeen replaced by a Flood Advisory.\nThe National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg has issued a\n* Flood Advisory for\nThe French Broad River At Blantyre.\n* until Tuesday morning.\n* The French Broad River crested at 15.73 feet at 215 PM on April 15,\n2019.\n* At 06 PM Monday the stage was 15.7 feet and falling slowly.\n* Action/Advisory Stage is 15.0 feet.\n* Minor Flood Stage is 16.0 feet.\n* FORECAST: The river will continue to fall gradually below Action/\nAdvisory Stage by 11 AM on Tuesday, April 16, 2019.\n* IMPACTS: At 16.0 feet: Minor Flood Stage. Farmland flooding\ncontinues on both sides of the French Broad River. Floodwaters\nbegin to impact boat access areas at Grove Bridge Rd. and Crab\nCreek Rd.\n* IMPACTS: At 15.0 feet: Action Stage.  Most farm fields are flooding\nbetween the French Broad River and Brevard Rd. and between the\nFrench Broad River and Pleasant Grove Rd.",
                "instruction": "PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...\n\nA Flood Advisory for a river forecast point means that nuisance\nflooding is expected to occur along the river when the river level is\nforecast to be just below or at the official Minor Flood Stage.\n\nCaution is urged when walking near river banks...keep children away\nfrom drainage areas, culverts, boat-access ramps, greenways, and\nparks along the river.",
